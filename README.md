# Project-1
A repository for the first computational physics project

# Summary
This project attempts to analyze resonant structures using MO Theory. By modeling the resonant structures using a decay equation, the beahviour of decays and populations was recorded. From this, results consistent with the quantum wave equation were observed, such as the averages being non-observables, and the amounts only scaling the average. Weighting values were also observed, which is consistent with the quantum theory of resonance.
