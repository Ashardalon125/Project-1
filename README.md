## Project-1
A repository for the first computational physics project

## Summary
This project attempts to analyze resonant structures using MO Theory. By modeling the resonant structures using a decay equation, the beahviour of decays and populations was recorded. From this, results consistent with the quantum wave equation were observed, such as the averages being non-observables, and the amounts only scaling the average. Weighting values were also observed, which is consistent with the quantum theory of resonance.

## Instructions for Installation
This program runs in Jupyter notebook. In order to get the software, please follow the instructions on their website, http://jupyter.org/.

Specifically, this program uses Anaconda3. Once installed, this notebook may be forked for personal use. Programs from the individual files can be imported into other projects, or space in the sheets themselves may be used to run the calculations.
