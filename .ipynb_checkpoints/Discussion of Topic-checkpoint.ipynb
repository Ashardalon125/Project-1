In reality, the actual Benzene molecule does not resemble either of these structures, and is instead a fusion between the two, referred to as the \"resonance hybrid.\" Notably, according to Valence-Bond Theory (VB Theory), these two structures must satisfy the quantum symmetry of its waveform. In most instances of having a single molecule with multiple potential formats, the formats are all equivalent, and thus, equally possible.

Thus, if by some chemical or physical situation, one structure is preferred over the other, then the behaviour of the hybrid can be appropriately calculated. Further, the weighted waveform version allows the populations to be scaled, so long as the weights are treated appropriately."

The models showed that the populations eventually stabilized, and the average between the two could be taken to represent the resonance hybrid. When both populations are equally preferred, they meet at the average, while populations with different weightings yielded an average that lay between their two asymptotes."
